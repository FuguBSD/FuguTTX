FuguTTX is TTX 1: a small language model and agent for OpenBSD system administration.
TTX 1 is a fine-tune of Qwen3-4B. It runs on the CPU, on OpenBSD, in 16 GB of RAM or
less, through llama.cpp.
The `ttx` harness — Perl 5, base modules only — operates the model in the boundaries of
pledge, unveil, doas rules, and dry-run gates.

## The specification is a living document

The specification in [`spec/`](spec/index.md) governs all work.
Read the [decisions](spec/decisions.md) before you make a plan.
A plan must not go against a decision.

The specification is not frozen.
It must agree with the project at all times.
Apply these rules:

- When your change alters a design, an interface, or a procedure, update the
  specification in the same change.
- When the specification is wrong or not complete, correct the specification.
  Do not work around it, and do not let code and specification drift apart.
- When your change goes against a decision, stop.
  Propose a change to [decisions](spec/decisions.md) and get human approval first.
- When you update the specification, write the text so that it describes the
  current state only.
  Do not write the update as an amendment or a revision, and do not refer to an
  earlier state.

## Critical: writing standard

All output and all artifacts must comply with ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.
This rule applies to documentation, specifications, runbooks, dataset cards, model
cards, commit messages, and pull requests.
Write short sentences, in the active voice, with one instruction per sentence.
Use “must” for a requirement, “must not” for a prohibition, and “can” for a capability.
